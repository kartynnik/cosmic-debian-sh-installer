## Status

I see it working on my Debian Trixie notebook.

### Known issues
- unlock screen not working ("permission denied" on the unlock dialog)
- seems it cannot recognize active ethernet connection

## Usage

To download packages and install
```sh
bash setup.sh --install
```

## License

Blindly converted by free AI from [ashimokawa/cosmic-debian-installer](https://codeberg.org/ashimokawa/cosmic-debian-installer)
with some minor cosmetic tweaks.

So - as a derivative work of GPL code - this is distributed under GPL as well.

- POSIX sh
- curl
- gunzip or gzip
- awk
- grep
- basename
